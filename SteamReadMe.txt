[h1]Quasimorph Explored Outline[/h1]


[h1]Info[/h1]

This mod changes the outline of storage containers that have already been opened, even if they have items still in them.  By default the outline is green, but this can be configured.
Storage containers are items on the floor, cabinets, bodies, etc.

Unexplored and empty containers will still follow the normal game rules where white is unexplored and a light outline for empty.

[h1]Configuration[/h1]

The mod can be configured in the Mods menu at the main menu, or directly in the file located at [i]%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\QM-ChangeExploredColor\QM-ChangeExploredColor.json[/i] .
